# Online-Restaurant-Booking-System

<ins>A University Project</ins>

The Online Restaurant Booking System is a web application designed to be used as a portal for users to be able to make restaurant table reservations/bookings. 

This application is designed to achieve the functionality of well-known booking systems such as OpenTable (previously known as TopTable) achieves but without the complexity behind it. It is designed to make it easy to use for clients with a wide level of technical ability and understanding with the ability to use the application inside restaurants to serve as a reservation based system for tables within the restaurant. 

The application has an administrative side allowing restaurant staff to manage bookings and other data. It also demonstrates the clients/customers are able to go through the booking process to make a successful booking by to signing into the system using their account (which they are able to create) and make bookings.

The aim of the project was to create a secure, robust online restaurant booking system which is user-friendly and effective for users of the system allowing them to reserve a table for any restaurant created on the system itself.
